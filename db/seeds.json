Two land-races and a hybrid have been expertly combined to produce a THC powerhouse that has an effect that even the most experienced cannabis aficionados will find undeniable and insistent. Amnesia Haze has dense flower clusters that are hard to the touch when cured lovingly. So well-crystallised are the firm nuggets, that they seem to have been lightly glazed with some kind of exotic cardamom and lime, marjoram and mandarin flavoured toffee that sparkles and refracts the light. The overdrive trichome production makes Amnesia Haze prized for hashes and other extractions. Warmed and twenty tonne pressed, the clear honey-coloured 22% THC resin waterfalls are a sticky sight to behold and an incomparable aromatic revelation.",

A potent hybrid, that had incredible flavor and was easy to grow, White Widow quickly became a popular strain among consumers and growers alike. It first made its appearance in the cannabis scene in the mid-nineties, and has gone on to obtain legendary status among cannabis consumers around the world. Its true origins are only suspected, as many have claimed to have been the first to breed White widow. What is suspected, is that the first White Widow came from the Green House Seed Company and master grower Shantibaba. It is also believed, that the first White Widow was a cross between two landrace strains; a Brazilian sativa and an Indian indica, however, the uncertainty behind the original parents has left White Widow shrouded in mystery. White Widow flowers into dense, pale green buds, with their famous white coating of trichomes spreading out onto the surrounding leaves. The appearance is hard to overlook, as White Widow tends to stand out in any grow. As a stable cross of landrace genetics, White Widow is resistant to swings in climate and can thrive with less care than most other strains, making it a great choice for your garden if you are just starting to develop your green thumb.",

What is known for sure, is that the Northern Lights we know and love today, made it's way from the outskirts of Seattle some time around 1985 to Amsterdam, where Neville Schoenmaker and his Seed Bank - later to become Sensi Seeds - developed it further. There are three phenotypes of the strain, numbered as they were originally numbered from the seeds used in '85: Northern Lights #5 is the powerhouse of the family and the queen of indicas. Northern Lights #1 and #2 are often used to make crossings with, because they add great flavour and that special Northern Lights high to the new creation. The #1 and #2 are outstanding in themselves, but when bred with another strain they spawn a flavour and smoke recognized immediately world wide with the body loading and psychoactive sensations of a true cannabis superstar.",

The good resin producer from California impresses with a intensive full-flavoured smoke and a mind-blowing high: the staples of great West Coast weed! For many cannabis lovers, nothing can be better than strains from the West Coast of the United States. Sour Diesel is one of these famed legends. Bred under the endless Californian sun, she is based on the Original Diesel with added Northern Lights, Shiva and Hawaiian genetics which give her amazing qualities and the plant many enthusiastic fans all over the world.This mostly sativa (70% sativa) grows very well indoors where she will normally reach a height of 90-160cm. There will be some stretching when she flowers but not as much as with other sativas. She will develop very resinous buds that will have a very intense aromatic scent to them in flowering.You can also grow her outdoors but then she will do best in a warm climate like in the Mediterranean. In such good conditions, when she has plenty of sun she will only get a little taller but can then yield as much as 600g per plant. Pretty-much like most cannabis strains, she will need about 3-4 weeks when she grows in the vegetative phase. After that, she will enter her flowering period that for a sativa-dominant hybrid is a pleasantly short 10 weeks. Like some of her other sisters from the West Coast of the USA, Sour Diesel shines with a unique flavour and some extraordinary potency. She delights with the trademark Diesel notes that make this line of cannabis so special along with some sour and herbal tones. With 19% of THC in her smoke and last but not least because of her stellar parents, she delivers a very powerful sativa high that is clear and focused together with some nice relaxation from her indica side. Sour Diesel is a legendary strain for so many good reasons. If you love sativas, you can’t go wrong with growing this West Coast favourite!",

This fabulous classic shines with a number of outstanding characteristics, like the unique Amnesia aroma and then of course her crazy-high potency and spectacular effect. The famous Amnesia owes her qualities to the fact that she ingeniously combines reliable oldschool genetics with that of a select Indica variety. Out came a very potent (up to 25% of THC!) indica that some cannabis lovers compare to the best Hazes when it comes to her effect and taste but still is entirely in its own league and unique among strains. When you smoke Amnesia, her flavour is nicely smooth and pleasant making her one of these smokes where you’re tempted to smoke some more and then some even when you know that you’ll probably already had enough. Like her unique taste, her effect is something really different and an amazing experience, one of the reasons why she is the favourite of so many connoisseurs. Her high is very positive and euphoric where you can enjoy endless waves of happiness as soon as you take your first hit. Although an sativa dominant strain, Amnesia has a good portion of indica in her and goes through her flowering time in 10 weeks. This is not record-breaking, but for a sativa or Haze it is an awesomely short time. But what’s outstanding isn’t the time but what she’ll do in those weeks: she will grow a very-nice harvest of up to 500g/m² of finest quality Amnesia bud for you! Moreover she is mould resistant and has a natural defence against mites and some other common pests which makes growing her in particular hassle-free. You absolutely can’t go wrong with growing this classic, simply ask any of her many fans that she has everywhere. Her superb taste and then the sheer sensational high make for a smoke that is still unmatched – typical Amnesia! PS Amnesia gets mixed up often with Amnesia Haze, but be aware that these two are not the same strains!",

Hailing from famed parents Critical Mass and OG Kush, this 90-100% indica is simultaneously perfect for growers and consumers looking for a high yield and equally staggering THC content. Critical Kush is frequently described as one of the more pungent, earthy smelling strains and the same goes for her taste. Other aromatic notes include lemon and lime citrus, with evident spice. Critical Kush maintains a classic kush taste with a focus on earthy and woody notes and a lingering sweetness throughout. The effects of Critical Kush manifest in powerful body highs that are excellent for those seeking deep relaxation and de-stressing. This strain is recommended for nighttime use and is especially helpful in treating symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. The high culminates in an overall feeling of well-being with noticeable euphoria. Smokers have also reported on this strain’s potency in managing chronic pain. Despite a high THC content, maxing out at around 25%, Critical Kush doesn’t generate any anxiety or paranoia. Additionally, the strain contains around 2% CBD, which only enhances its medical potential. The only noticeable “drawbacks” of the smoking experience are possible cottonmouth and dizziness. The success of Critical Kush cannot be overstated as more and more growers begin to recognize the plant’s potential. The strain won first place in the Indoors/Hydroponics category at the Spannabis Champions Cup in 2015, highlighting its heavy stone and warming euphoria effect.
