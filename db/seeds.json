		"info": "There’s something quite special about an indica that really does its job. Critical Kush is one such example where the most desirable traits of an indica are heightened, without sending smokers into eternal couch-lock. Hailing from famed parents Critical Mass and OG Kush, this 90-100% indica is simultaneously perfect for growers and consumers looking for a high yield and equally staggering THC content. Critical Kush is frequently described as one of the more pungent, earthy smelling strains and the same goes for her taste. Other aromatic notes include lemon and lime citrus, with evident spice. Critical Kush maintains a classic kush taste with a focus on earthy and woody notes and a lingering sweetness throughout. The effects of Critical Kush manifest in powerful body highs that are excellent for those seeking deep relaxation and de-stressing. This strain is recommended for nighttime use and is especially helpful in treating symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. The high culminates in an overall feeling of well-being with noticeable euphoria. Smokers have also reported on this strain’s potency in managing chronic pain. Despite a high THC content, maxing out at around 25%, Critical Kush doesn’t generate any anxiety or paranoia. Additionally, the strain contains around 2% CBD, which only enhances its medical potential. The only noticeable “drawbacks” of the smoking experience are possible cottonmouth and dizziness. The success of Critical Kush cannot be overstated as more and more growers begin to recognize the plant’s potential. The strain won first place in the Indoors/Hydroponics category at the Spannabis Champions Cup in 2015, highlighting its heavy stone and warming euphoria effect. Critical Kush has become an instant classic and a textbook example of the qualities that comprise a perfect indica. As its popularity surges, Critical Kush will continue to dominate its field.",

Like most pedigree sativas, the Chocolope is highly conducive to the ScrOG method and recommended unless you have plenty of space for great big ganja trees.

If you’re still wondering why Gorilla Glue is one of the most-talked about strains these days, how about 24-26% of THC with some of her phenos measuring an incredible 30%? Saying that the Gorilla is “potent” would possibly be the understatement of the century! But Gorilla Glue is much more than “just” an ultra-powerful Indica. She shines with an insane amount of aromatic trichomes giving her an excellent flavour that blends earthy and sweet notes with lemon and pine tones as well as her trademark massive resin production that makes her buds and the entire plant super-sticky like glue so you better be careful at harvest time :). Gorilla Glue’s effect, while extremely powerful isn’t just one-sided. She makes for very deep relaxation when you smoke her but she also adds just the right amount of uplifting euphoria which makes smoking her so different and a great experience! Because of her power, she can also be a good choice for medicinal users who find that strains high in THC can bring them relief. She can help with all kinds of conditions, from chronic pains to insomnia to depression and much more. Her crazy potency and her spectacular aroma and effect should explain why Gorilla Glue is one of these “must have” strains for every serious grower. Enjoy her and you will understand that the hype is indeed real and well justified!",

Said differently, she more than deserves her reputation and that she’s the talk of so many cannabis lovers these days! Girl Scout Cookies is an indica/sativa hybrid that began as a crossbreed of an OG Kush, which is s legendary balanced indica/sativa with a Durban Poison which is a pure sativa. She has 60% indica dominance but what makes her stand out is her crazy THC content that can reach a staggering 28%. With these impressive numbers, these scouting girls are one of the most potent strains available today, with some serious benefits not just for stoners who can’t say no to some premium West Coast ganja but also for many medicinal users! Her high isn’t just immensely powerful but it combines the best of sativa and indica into a smoke experience that really couldn’t be any better. She gives a uplifting and euphoric high like that as you can get from the best sativas but mixes it with an awesome indica stone so she’s really delivering the best of both cannabis worlds in one awesome smoke! While Girl Scout Cookies is not necessarily the easiest strain to grow, most growers simply and entirely understandably can’t resist growing her and are happily accepting the slightly more effort it might at times need to grow her. The result at the end sure will absolutely be worth it, just ask anyone who had the pleasure to try her. Girl Scout Cookies are already a legend and you shouldn't need to think twice whether you want to grow her!",
